/// A reader-writer lock
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of thislock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// In comparison, a [`Mutex`] does not distinguish between readers or writers
/// that acquire the lock, therefore blocking any threads waiting for the lock
/// to become available. An `RwLock` will allow any number of readers to
/// acquire the lock as long as a writer is not holding the lock.
///
/// The type parameter T represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that T satisfies [`Send`] to be shared across threads and [`Sync`]
/// to allow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guard returned from
/// the locking methods implement [`Deref`] (and [`DerefMut`] for the `write`
/// methods) to allow access to the content of the lock.
///
/// Locking the mutex on a thread that already locked it is impossible, due to
/// the requirement of the [`ThreadKey`]. Therefore, this will never deadlock.
